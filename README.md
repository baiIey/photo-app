# Focus

Focus is a proof of concept app that explores iOS' [Photos Framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Photos/Reference/Photos_Framework/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014408), which allows us to request assets and commit edits to the photo library.

Designers [Patrick Wong](https://twitter.com/patrickswong), [Brian Bailey](https://twitter.com/bbaiIey), and [Nico Bories](https://twitter.com/nicobories) fetched, presented, and stored images in a custom collection using a nondestructive image adjustment process that allow users to revert or alter their edits.

Our custom editing allows controls for brightness, saturation, contrast, cropping, rotation, and temperature.
